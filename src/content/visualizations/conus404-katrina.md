#### About the Science

Animation of 3D cloud fraction (white and purple), 2D precipitation rate (pink), 3D ice hydrometeor mixing ratio (green), and 3D liquid hydrometeor mixing ratio (blue) during the Hurricane Katrina period using the CONUS404 data. This animation shows that high impact historical weather events have been well captured by the CONUS404 data set.
