**Forecasting decadal trends in the North Atlantic and Arctic.** Decadal climate predictions exhibit skill in retrospective predictions of observed multi-year trends in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice fraction in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the Atlantic sector. The skill is largely attributable to realistic ocean initialization, but external radiative forcing also contributes some skill. Here, we compare the spatiotemporal evolution of 10-year SST and sea ice fraction trends from the CESM Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (CESM-DPLE; Yeager et al. 2018), which includes both initialization and external forcing, to historical trends diagnosed from the CESM Large Ensemble of 20th Century simulations (CESM-LE; Kay et al. 2015), which only includes external forcing effects. The observed SST data is from the HADISST1 product merged with the NOAA-OI product (Hurrell et al. 2008); the observed sea ice fraction data is from the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) passive microwave product NSIDC-0051 (Cavalieri et al. 1996).
