Simulated ocean surface boundary layer turbulence under Hurricane Irene (~9:30 UTC, August 28, 2011) entrains cold bottom water that cools the sea surface and weakens the hurricane as it makes landfall on the New Jersey continental shelf. 

<br />

Large-aspect-ratio coherent structures that modify the evolution of the mean sea-surface temperature are highlighted in a 2 km by 2 km by 35 m deep domain.

<br />

These large structures, which are neither well-observed nor explicitly accounted for in typical ocean models, modestly but systematically alter the vertical fluxes of momentum and temperature under the storm. Hence, forecast models of sea-surface temperature change under a hurricane may require new observations and parameterizations of ocean turbulence that explicitly address the large-aspect-ratio structures.

As the hurricane approaches and the wind intensifies, the ocean surface current (orange) organizes into streaks along the wind direction. About 10 m below the surface, intermittent billows perturb the temperature interface (blue-gray) and drive exchange between the warm surface and cold bottom waters on the Mid-Atlantic Bight.
