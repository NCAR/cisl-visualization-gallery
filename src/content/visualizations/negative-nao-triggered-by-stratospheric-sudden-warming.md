Seasonal forecast for winter of 1997/1998 with 46LCAM (Ensemble member with a sudden stratospheric warming).

This is a 4 month forecast of surface geopotential height anomalies (shown with surface relief and contour lines) and surface temperature anomalies (shown with a color gradient). The forecast starts on Dec 1, 1997, and goes through the end of March, 1998. It illustrates the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern that gets triggered by a stratospheric sudden warming.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a major fluctuation in atmospheric pressure over a large area in the northern Atlantic Ocean, and it affects weather conditions in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Stratospheric sudden warmings typically produce negative NAO patterns at the surface. A negative NAO is often associated with colder conditions in eastern North America and northern Europe brought on by more-frequent intrusions of Arctic air.
