On October 14, 2020, the East Troublesome Wildfire ignited. It burnt 193,812 acres over the course of 48 days. Between October 20-23 the wildfire rapidly intensified, exploding from 18,550 acres to 187,964 acres in size.* These visualizations show a Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) simulation of the East Troublesome Wildfire from the perspective of Granby, Colorado. It uses a physics module (WRF-Fire) that incorporates an AI driven model for combustable plant matter known as Beetle Kill.
