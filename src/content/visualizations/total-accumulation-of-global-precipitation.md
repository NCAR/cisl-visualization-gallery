Project Metis: Seasonal Forecasts with Enhanced Ocean and Atmosphere Resolution

<br />

This visualization shows total accumulation of global precipitation (blue/purple) and the 6-hourly precipitation (yellow/red) between May 1 and Nov 1, 2015.

<br />

What to look for: Of particular interest are the cyclones that scrawl lines across the map, leaving a visible trail in the total precipitation field.

##### Computational Resources

This research was enabled by NCAR-CISL compute resources.  The simulation was run on Cheyenne, a 5.34-petaflops, SGI ICE XA Cluster featuring 145,152 Intel Xeon processor cores in 4,032 dual-socket nodes and 313 TB of total memory.

##### Data Source

The data for the visualization was generated as part of Project Metis, a continuation of the highly successful collaboration between the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA), located at George Mason University, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), in support of both centersâ€™ ongoing efforts to understand and quantify predictability in the climate system from daily to interannual time scales.

<br />

The Metis project explores the impact of increasing both atmospheric and oceanic resolution on model fidelity and prediction skill in a coupled ocean (waves, currents and sea-ice), land and atmosphere ensemble framework.
