This visualization shows 4-year running means of snow cover over North America from 1853 to 2100. These visualizations were created using the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). Primary sponsors of CCSM are the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science.

#### About the Science

##### Science Credits

Synte Peacock, NCAR

These simulations were made possible because of the large number of individuals both from within NCAR and the many outside collaborators who have contributed to the CCSM4 development and runs.

##### Computational Resources

Computing resources were provided by the Climate Simulation Laboratory at NCAR’s Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL), sponsored by the National Science Foundation and other agencies. This research was enabled by CISL compute and storage resources. Bluefire, a 4,064-processor IBM Power6 resource with a peak of 77 TeraFLOPS provided more than 7.5 million computing hours, the GLADE high-speed disk resources provided 0.4 PetaBytes of dedicated disk and CISL’s 12-PB HPSS archive provided over 1 PetaByte of storage in support of this research project.
