This visualization depicts carbon monoxide (CO) concentration over Asian. The data were generated from a simulation of 2021. The visualization coincides with the upcoming (July â€“ August 2022) Asian Summer Monsoon Chemical and Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP). The scientists will fly from Osan, South Korea, over eastern Asia and the Pacific to gather similar data from the environment, then compare the results to the simulated data.
