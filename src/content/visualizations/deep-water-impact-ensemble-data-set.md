The Deep Water Impact Ensemble Data Set was generated from large simulations of asteroids crashing into the ocean. These simulations were run using various sizes of asteroids and angles of entry in order to study the aftermath of the impacts. The data set was the subject matter for the 2018 IEEE VIS SciVis Contest, held in Berlin, Germany. This particular visualization compares the water fraction, asteroid fraction, and pressure variables for two ensemble runs: one where there is no airburst (the full asteroid impacts the ocean), and one where there is an airburst (the asteroid breaks apart before impact). The movie won third place honorable mention in the 2018 contest.
