The System for Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA) has rolled out two new variable-resolution configurations with regional refinement over the Arctic and Greenland*. This is a 3D visualization of a simulation using the Greenland grid, which refines the big ice sheet with 1/8˚ grid resolution. The visualization shows that storms traverse the refinement region without numerical distortion. These storms splash onto the high-resolution representation of the Greenland Ice Sheet, producing realistic accumulation patterns for a more accurate surface mass balance. This configuration is currently being used to project the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet and global sea-level into the future, a joint collaboration between AMWG and the land ice working group.

<br />

*These new configurations are available in the latest version of CESM.
