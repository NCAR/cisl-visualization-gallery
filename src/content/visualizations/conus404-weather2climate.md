#### About the Science

Animation of 40 years of CONUS404 2D variables: outgoing longwave radiation (white), precipitation rate (blue to yellow indicating low to high value), and water vapor mixing ratio at 2 m (brown to green indicating low to high value). Fields representing time scales from hour to decade are shown to illustrate the transition from weather to climate, which highlights the advantage of the CONUS404 dataset for research topics across time scales.
