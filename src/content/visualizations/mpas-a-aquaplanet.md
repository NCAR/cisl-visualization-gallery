#### About the Science

The data come from an aquaplanet simulation produced with the Model for Prediction Across Scale-Atmosphere (MPAS-A). The simulation was produced by configuring MPAS-A as a water-covered sphere with a zonally symmetric sea-surface temperature profile. The visualization shows that the simulation captures convective storms in the tropics, including tropical cyclones, and their near-surface interactions.
