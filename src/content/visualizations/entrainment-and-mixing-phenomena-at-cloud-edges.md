#### About the Science

This work depicts data obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of entrainment and mixing processes at a cloud's edge, which affect the droplet dynamics due to evaporation and condensation. This simulation contains coupled Eulerian and Lagrangian frames.

##### Computational Modeling

Bipin Kumar and Neethi Suresh (HPCS, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology)

##### Computational Resources

The simulation was carried out on a HPC facility provided by the Ministry of Earth Science, Government of India at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune (http://pratyush.tropmet.res.in/). The computational time and data storage was provided through the HPCS project. The authors thank Dr. Jason R. Picardo, IIT Bombay, India, for helpful discussions to understand the physics in the animations generated in this study.

<br />

The visualizations were created using computing and storage resources provided by the Computational and Information Systems Lab at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The National Center for Atmospheric Research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
