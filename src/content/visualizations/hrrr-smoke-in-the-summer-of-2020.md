These volume renderings show the simulated dispersal of smoke generated with the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model. This visualization emphasizes the Western wildfires during the last days of August 2020. Science credit to Ka Yee Wong and Ravan Ahmadov, of NOAA’s Global Systems Laboratory.
