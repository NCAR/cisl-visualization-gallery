Precipitation in warm clouds can be explained by coalescing water droplets. This coalescence can be accelerated by turbulent vortices within the cloud. In this visualization, we see how this turbulence drives the coalescence of large and small droplets.

##### Computational Resources

This research was enabled by NCAR’s Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) compute and storage resources. This visualization shows a portion of a 7 million core hour set of simulations. Data stored on NCAR’s “glade” filesystem, and visualized on NCAR’s Casper visualization cluster.
