NSF NCAR has implemented Virtual and [Augmented Reality](/cisl-visualization-gallery/visualizations/augmented-reality) (AR/VR) technologies to help make NCAR science more engaging and accessible to a wider audience. We have developed mobile apps and tools that enable users to explore geoscience data from their mobile device, such as an iPhone, iPad, or an Android device.   The apps are free and available for download at the Apple Store and for Android devices at Google Play.

#### Meteo VR

Meteo VR is a **Virtual Reality** (VR) application that works with inexpensive devices like Google Cardboard to turn your mobile phone into a 3D VR platform for exploring geoscience data.  Google Cardboard is available for purchase from many online retailers.  Search “Google Cardboard.”  Note: make sure the cardboard device has an “interactive click button”.
