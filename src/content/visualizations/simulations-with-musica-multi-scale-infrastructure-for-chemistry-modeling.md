These visualizations depict simulations created with MUSICA (Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry Modeling). The first simulation examines the Carbon Monoxide (CO) generated by a fire plume during the major fire events that occurred in the western United States in 2022. The second simulation depicts Ozone (O3) in the troposphere over a region of the western US in Summer 2020.
