To insert a full-width video, see Share -> Embed on a YouTube video and copy the iframe code. For example: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXAMPLE-URL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
